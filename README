This is my first project in python.
A number guessing game that generates a number between 1-50 
then it ask a player to guess the number by providing an input
there's an error function that ensures the input is an integer
once the input is provided, it compares it with the computer generated number
and if the guess is a correct one, it indicates it and also if its a wrong guess there's an indicator for that as well while also telling the player the right number
there's a total of five guesses per game and in each guess, it displays the number of guesses remaining.
and at the end of the game
I'm hoping there are more efficient ways of wrting this same program with lesser lines of code.
Feel free to show me better ways, thanks in advance.
